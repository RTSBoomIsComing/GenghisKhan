# This Project is in progress...

## This project based on win32 API and directx 11 (d3d11)
## This project based on programming language C++20, MSBuild.
## This project needs some opensource libraries below.
- directxtk
- directxmath (not now)
- imgui
- entt
- assimp (not now)

## All additional libraries are installed by vcpkg.
## So it requires Visual studio with vcpkg MSBuild integration.
## See the vcpkg.json file.
Visual studio projects are set to use vcpkg manifest mode.
So you don't need to install libraries manually,
Once you build visual studio solution all the libraries installed automatically.
